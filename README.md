# SQLite-Investigation
Repository detailing my investigation into sqlite

## Opening Remarks
This is the first time that I've worked with a database but the syntax that I see is very similar to code that I've seen before.

`
cursor.execute("select * from gta where city=:c", {"c", "Liberty City"})
`

As an example, this is very similar to linq that I've seen before, though I do plan on learning more about it once I have the opportunity to.
